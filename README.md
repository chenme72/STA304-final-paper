I plan to analysis the Canadian Survey on Disability (CSD), which can be access by The Canadian Government Data website: https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/type/data?text=insurance&geoname=A0000&subject_levels=13&p=1-All#all 
--> Industry of employment for persons with and without disabilities aged 25 to 64 years, by sex --> download options --> csv
The dataset is about Industry of employment for persons with and without disabilities aged 25 to 64 years, by sex.
My goal is to analysis the relationship between age vs. diability, sex vs. diability and other influencing factors of working as diabilities, if possible. I might be merge some datasets from the CSD to obtain more information for the analysis, which can also access by the Canadian Government Data website. 
So the analysis is seperated into following parts: 
abstract, introduction, data, results, discussion, appendix and reference. 
The abstract and introduction is to introduce the importance, goal and purpose of this analysis 
The data section is to analysis the key features of the dataset, introduce the data source, methology, strength and the weakness of the survey (or the dataset).
The results section contains the analysis beween the varaibles, telling a story from the dataset. 
The discussion contains a deeper thinking and investigation from the results section, also the strength, limitation of the analysis will be discussed.
